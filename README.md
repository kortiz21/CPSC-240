## Instructions:
Compile and Run: Use `sh r.sh` in folder directory for specific project.

Debug: Use `sh rg.sh` in folder directory for specific project.

## Description

Programming assignments that were all completed throughout the course using a combination of assembly, C, C++ and bash. 

### Project 1:

This program will compute the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the two sides in addition to detecting and rejecting negative inputs.

### Project 2:

This program will create arrays, inputs values into arrays, calculate the magnitude of elements in the array, append an array to another array and validate if element in an array is a float. 

### Project 3:

This program will generate up to 100 random number using the non-deterministic random number generator found inside of modern X86 microprocessors. Initially random numbers are generated that extend throughout the entire space of all 64-bit IEEE754 numbers. Additionally, the program will normalize each random number so that it lies in the interval 1.0 <= num < 2.0.

### Project 4:

This program will benchmark the performance of the square root instruction in SSE and also the square root program in the standard C library.

### Project 5:

This program will do  input data validation for floats and calculate the sine function using the Taylor series, while benchmarking the performance between the Taylor series calculation of sine and the built in library for sine.

### Midterm:

This program will compute the value of Work (W) in jules from inputs Time (T), Current (I), and Voltage (V).
